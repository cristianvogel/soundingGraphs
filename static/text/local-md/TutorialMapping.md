Let's explore the mapping concept further. First we will synthesise some random data. But it won't be completely random. We will use a smoothed random algorithm called [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Perlin) to generate a more natural, harmonic succession of numbers than that of full randomness.
